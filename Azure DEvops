Migration to repo

Step1: 
git clone addressbook.git --bare
step2:
git push addressbook.git --mirror
Commit/Pre-commit Hooks
In bitbucket , with the ability of external pre-receive hook plugin , we make sure that  every file which is part of Git Commit  has a option 
azure repo dont have option . azure can do through PR build

For permission:
* To sync the AD and have AD group just as LDAP 
* set the permission for these group but not useers , also giving permission to a group and then don't deny permission seperately 

Build agent:
Maven
Azure pipeline Agent executable
Twistcli
Azcli
Helmcli
kubectl
java
JQ
unzip
nodejs
python

Docker images
  base image with Azure pipeline agent 
  azureagent-jsb:1.0
  dockerimage for nodejs
* Deployed these build agent as kubernetes deployment and scaled them up
To deploy any machine as agent
   a)PAT_TOKEN
   b)Agentpool
   c)Azuredevopsurl
   d)Agentname
 In case if we want agent running on Docker
  docker run -it -d -e AZ_Url=https://dev.azure.com/addressbook -e AZ_Token =<token> -e az_agent_name=dockeragent -e azp_pools=agent_name - v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock azureagent:1.0
  
  * currently no of slave are ran simulataneously are 5 for more number of parallel builds . For more number of parallel build , the pricing changes .This should be considered when we want to run multiple build stage in parallel
  
* Added the capabilities for agent to segregate them for this purpose like for e.g using diff agent for  maven or nodejs build.If we chose to go with Dynamic scaling, we will need to have different pools for each type of agents
* for Angular build we configured windows machine as one of Azure pipeline agent

PAAS:
PAT Token
Azure registry
Sonar
Veracode
TWISTLOCK
SSH

Branch Policies:
 * Require minimum number of reviewer
 * check for comment resolution
 * Build validate -PR build.yaml reside in the same location of pipeline.yml - Build expiration is set as immediate when develop is update
 *Flexibility to have Devops as approver
 
 Azure pipeline:
 ================
 Create pipeline in GUI based then converted in to Yaml 
 * stored the npmrc nd yarnc  and setings.xml as secred files
 * Azure
