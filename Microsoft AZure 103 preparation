manage azure subcriptions and resources
 1) implementing azure policy:
   A policy definition expresses what to evaluate and what actions to take.
   2)create initiative - An initiative definition is a set of policy definitiona to help track your compilance state for a larger goal
   3)You can limit the scope of the initiative definition to management groups,subcriptions or resource groups
   
   4)Once the initiative definition is assigned,you can evaluate the state of compilance for all your resources

AZure file storage 
reliable and fault tolerant
create AZure file storage
AZure Table storage Keys
  it has 
  --> Partition Key 
  --> Row key
  
  A partition is a consecutive range of entities possesing the same partition key value

Row key --> unique key finds a particular column in a partition key

AZure storage queues:
Storage queues allow us put message in them so other process can read and process those messages . For e.g a message might contain email address of newly signed up
user .Other processes can take message from the queue and send those message mails
FiFO data structure
Azure queue storage is a cloud based service that allows us to offload time consuming task from front end to backend

Queuing Service concepts
1)  storage Account
2)url format
3) Queue --> set of messages must be all lowercase
4)Message -can be any format up to 64 kb  .the max timeto liive alowed can be any postive number or -1 indicate messge doesn;t expire 
 message will be deleted from azure storge queue based on queue expire date
 
 Azure storage explorer
  1) Blog storage -> view ,delete
  2)Queue storage: Peek most 32 mssage
    dequeue message
   3) Table storage
   4)File storage
   
   Azure shared access signature
   token will be generated for access the Azure storage resources
   Data Replication option:
    --> Locally Redundant storage(LRS)
    --> Zone redundant storage(ZRS)
    -->Geo-redudant storage (GRS)
    --> Read access geo redundant storage(RA
    
    Azure storage Replication:
    ====================
    copies the data for planned and unplanned the ebvents
    LRS: 3 copies of data with the same region
    ZRS: ssingle region replica your data syncronously 
    GRS: 100 miles away from primary region
         natural disaster ..replica a data through seciondary region
         
    Read access geo redundant storage(RA GRS)
     read only access for replica data

AZure import export Service:
ship phtyscial disk to azure blob or file in azure data centre 
1)Data migration
2)Content distribution
3)Backup
 4)Data Recovery
 
 ship the hard drive using import/export client tool 
 create an import/export job using AZ Portal 
 Step 1: create
 Step2: Shipping
 3)Transferring
 4)Packing
 5)Complete
 
 Azure File Sync:
 
 Back up solution
 Data recovery 
 Syncronzie service from onpremises to Azure cloud
 
 --> Azure file sync allows the syncronization of on-premises file server with Azure files supported by storage accounts
 --> Azure file sync is powered by local caches and continous syncronizes with Windows Server
 
 --> 
 
 Azure BLOB storage
 =====================
 backup data to the microsoft cloud
 1)AZ copy--> copy to second storage account 
 2)Snapshot --> cannot storage in the Azure vault 
 3)Azure Archieve storage
 --Blob storage can create snapshot
 Azure Archieve storage --> automatically encrypted 
  --> similar like hot,cool storage method, low rate for the storage
    store the data very rarely 
    --> low latency
    
    SAS --> Shared access signature
    --> 
    2 storage account
    1)source --az copy source
    2)azcopy destianation
    we need define role for storage account 
    role: storage blob contributor
    user:prabhu
    
    shared access signature -->
    Allowed services
    1)Blob
    2)File

     Azure CDN:
     ===
     
     Azure Content Delivery Network is a cloud service that works by providing alternative server nodes for users to download services 
     a cached version of a application in another region 
     --> AZure CDN is global CDN solution for delivering high bandwdth content
     
     you can cache static object

Azure subcription and Resources
=========
Users should have subcription to access the services
To use this tool Azure cli,poweshell they need to create a account 
user can have multiple account 
Resource: any service offered by azure
Resource group: collection of services wwhich application are grouped together

Relationship btwn Azure subcription and Resource 

--> Every resource will be deployed within a resource group
--> Every resource can be be associated with azure subcription
