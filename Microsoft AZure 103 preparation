AZure file storage 
reliable and fault tolerant
create AZure file storage
AZure Table storage Keys
  it has 
  --> Partition Key 
  --> Row key
  
  A partition is a consecutive range of entities possesing the same partition key value

Row key --> unique key finds a particular column in a partition key

AZure storage queues:
Storage queues allow us put message in them so other process can read and process those messages . For e.g a message might contain email address of newly signed up
user .Other processes can take message from the queue and send those message mails
FiFO data structure
Azure queue storage is a cloud based service that allows us to offload time consuming task from front end to backend

Queuing Service concepts
1)  storage Account
2)url format
3) Queue --> set of messages must be all lowercase
4)Message -can be any format up to 64 kb  .the max timeto liive alowed can be any postive number or -1 indicate messge doesn;t expire 
 message will be deleted from azure storge queue based on queue expire date
 
 Azure storage explorer
  1) Blog storage -> view ,delete
  2)Queue storage: Peek most 32 mssage
    dequeue message
   3) Table storage
   4)File storage
   
   Azure shared access signature
   token will be generated for access the Azure storage resources
   Data Replication option:
    --> Locally Redundant storage(LRS)
    --> Zone redundant storage(ZRS)
    -->Geo-redudant storage (GRS)
    --> Read access geo redundant storage(RA
    
    Azure storage Replication:
    ====================
    copies the data for planned and unplanned the ebvents
    LRS: 3 copies of data with the same region
    ZRS: ssingle region replica your data syncronously 
    GRS: 100 miles away from primary region
         natural disaster ..replica a data through seciondary region
         
    Read access geo redundant storage(RA GRS)
     read only access for replica data

AZure import export Service:
ship phtyscial disk to azure blob or file in azure data centre 
1)Data migration
2)Content distribution
3)Backup
 4)Data Recovery
 
 ship the hard drive using import/export client tool 
 create an import/export job using AZ Portal 
 Step 1: create
 Step2: Shipping
 3)Transferring
 4)Packing
 5)Complete
 
 Azure File Sync:
 
 Back up solution
 Data recovery 
 Syncronzie service from onpremises to Azure cloud
 
 --> Azure file sync allows the syncronization of on-premises file server with Azure files supported by storage accounts
 --> Azure file sync is powered by local caches and continous syncronizes with Windows Server
 
 --> 
 
 Azure BLOB storage
 =====================
 backup data to the microsoft cloud
 1)AZ copy--> copy to second storage account 
 2)Snapshot --> cannot storage in the Azure vault 
 3)Azure Archieve storage
 --Blob storage can create snapshot
 Azure Archieve storage --> automatically encrypted 
  --> similar like hot,cool storage method, low rate for the storage
    store the data very rarely 
    --> low latency
